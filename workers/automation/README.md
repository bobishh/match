# Cloudflare automation worker

This Worker accepts bounded job submissions and forwarded email, stores each event in a per-integration SQLite Durable Object, and classifies events with Cloudflare Clef-flash. It keeps challenge nonces, idempotency keys, event state, retry count, and classification results durable across Worker restarts.

The public event response means **durably queued**. After a signed owner automation grant and fully admitted encrypted snapshot are activated, clear Clef decisions can create a Lead or move a uniquely matched application to Interview or Rejected. Each action is authored as an Automerge change, admitted against the current signed causal authority, persisted before Rusty upload, and reported as applied only after the signed upload receipt succeeds. Email matching uses a pre-classification snapshot; moves require a valid original `Date` header at least as new as the card workflow and reject concurrent workflow changes. Rejected applications never move backward. Ambiguous matches, uncertain classifications, expired grants, stale workflows, and unavailable proof stay in review or retry. Clef cannot authorize writes. The Worker never falls back to an Editor grant.

## Local setup

Use Node.js 22+ and pnpm. Install within this directory so the local `allowBuilds` policy permits only the `esbuild` and `workerd` build scripts used by the test runtime.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm types
pnpm check
pnpm test
pnpm test:runtime
```

`pnpm dev:e2e` starts the local-only browser-test Worker on Wrangler's default local port. Its separate `wrangler.e2e.jsonc` config exposes `POST /__test/configure` and `POST /__test/email` and contains test-only secrets; never deploy it.

`pnpm dev` runs local Wrangler. The AI binding reaches Cloudflare Workers AI and may incur usage charges when an event alarm performs classification.

Set local secrets in an ignored `.dev.vars` file:

```dotenv
HUMAN_CHECK_SECRET=replace-with-at-least-32-random-bytes
PROVISIONING_TOKEN=replace-with-a-long-random-operator-token
IDENTITY_STORAGE_SECRET=replace-with-at-least-32-random-bytes
EVENT_STORAGE_SECRET=replace-with-at-least-32-random-bytes
```

Do not commit these values. `IDENTITY_STORAGE_SECRET` encrypts the automation identity seed and device entropy before Durable Object storage. `EVENT_STORAGE_SECRET` encrypts accepted website payloads and both parsed email fields and original MIME bytes before storage. Rotating either secret without re-encrypting the stored value prevents it from loading.

## Integration routing

`INTEGRATIONS_JSON` is an environment variable containing an array of configured integration metadata. Each entry has this shape:

```json
{
  "id": "applications",
  "workspaceId": "workspace-id",
  "scope": {
    "version": 1,
    "boardId": "board-id",
    "columns": { "lead": "lead-column-id", "interview": "interview-column-id", "rejected": "rejected-column-id" },
    "fieldIds": { "company": "company-field-id", "role": "role-field-id", "jobUrl": "url-field-id" },
    "expiresAt": "2027-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  },
  "emailAddress": "applications@example.com",
  "allowedForwarders": ["owner@example.com"]
}
```

IDs are exact, stable document IDs. `emailAddress` selects the integration from the incoming SMTP envelope recipient. `allowedForwarders` matches the outer SMTP envelope sender exactly after lowercasing; it does not trust a `From:` header inside forwarded content and does not prove which Gmail account forwarded the message. Forwarding services may rewrite that sender, so configure only a value verified from a real delivery to this route. Until that behavior is verified, keep email intake disabled. Set the `CORS_ORIGINS` comma-separated list to the exact browser origins allowed to call the HTTP API. Keep the list empty for server-to-server intake.

The JSON describes routing and stable scope bindings; it is not a signed owner grant. The Worker does not accept a scope as authorization to mutate a board. Activation requires cryptographic grant validation and causal admission.

## Owner-managed activation

The ordinary setup is **Settings → Connections → Automations → Add automation**.
Owner selects the supported type, names the instance, enters the Worker origin,
and explicitly accepts reading access to the whole workspace. Rusty must already
be connected. The browser enrolls an independent Worker identity, signs the
versioned type definition and exact 30-day Automation grant, commits the public
approval/desired state to CRDT, then privately sends the admitted snapshot and
storage access to the selected Worker. Operator bearer tokens never enter this UI.

Deployment variable `AUTOMATION_OWNER_IDS` is a comma-separated allowlist of public
root person IDs permitted to enroll instances. Empty disables browser enrollment.
It is deployment authorization, not a workspace setting or secret. Activation
still independently validates current owner authority, scoped grant, definition
signature and every causal document change; the allowlist cannot authorize board
writes. Instances bind durably to one owner/workspace and cannot be reassigned.
Legacy operator endpoints and `INTEGRATIONS_JSON` remain compatible with existing
integrations; new UI instances derive routing only from validated activation.

- `GET /v2/capabilities`: supported type/version pairs and enrollment availability.
- `POST /v2/integrations/{uuid}/identity`: signed owner enrollment.
- `PUT /v2/integrations/{uuid}/activation`: `{ ownerRequest, packet }`; owner
  signature binds origin, instance, workspace, freshness and canonical packet hash.
- `POST /v2/integrations/{uuid}/observation`: signed owner query; returns Worker
  certificate and signed nonce-bound acknowledgement of admitted CRDT control heads.

Owner requests expire in 60 seconds. Browser checks Worker identity, origin,
instance, workspace, grant, nonce, freshness and exact desired heads before showing
confirmed state. Network failure, expired grant and unsynced controls stay pending.
Pause/resume/remove write only CRDT; no HTTP pause switch competes with the owner
record. Durable alarms poll controls every 15 seconds even with an empty queue.
Pause preserves queued events without spending retries or AI calls. Removal is a
terminal tombstone; retries and stale snapshots cannot resurrect execution.

Current UI registry contains `job-intake@1`, with website submissions enabled.
Email classification remains implemented for configured legacy recipients. New UI
instances do not advertise working email routes: Cloudflare Email Routing and a
verified forwarding envelope are still required before offering that source.
An added instance does not require a release; an added type/version does.

Private activation contains storage credentials, a content key and workspace
history. It is sent only to the approved HTTPS origin (loopback HTTP for tests),
never CRDT or public routing JSON. Rotating encryption secrets without migrating
stored state prevents restore. Each instance uses its own identity, SQLite queue
and encrypted replica chunks with atomic generation publication.

## HTTP and email entry points

- `GET /health` reports Worker readiness.
- `POST /v1/challenge` with `{ "integrationId": "applications" }` returns an HMAC-signed arithmetic challenge.
- `POST /v1/intake/{integrationId}` accepts the bounded website submission plus `humanCheckToken` and `humanCheckAnswer`. Optional `Idempotency-Key` makes client retries return the original event; distinct keys remain distinct events. A challenge nonce can be used once.
- `POST /v1/integrations/{integrationId}/identity` requires the operator bearer token and returns an independent automation identity's public keys and device certificate. Private seeds stay encrypted in that integration's Durable Object.
- `PUT /v1/integrations/{integrationId}/activation` requires the operator bearer token and a signed, scope-matched grant plus admitted snapshot.
- `GET /v1/integrations/{integrationId}/events/{eventId}` requires the operator bearer token and returns redacted event status and decision summary.
- Cloudflare's `email()` handler accepts only configured recipient and allowed outer sender pairs. Forwarding confirmation messages enter owner review.

New intake returns HTTP 202 after the Durable Object has stored the event. Clef or page-fetch failures stay retryable and move to `failed` after eight attempts. Unrelated, ambiguous, or not-yet-authorable decisions remain `review`; no response calls those events applied.

## Production deployment

The Worker is deployed at [`https://automation.meta-uber-engineer.dev`](https://automation.meta-uber-engineer.dev); `/health` returns `{"status":"ready"}`. Its `workers.dev` route and preview URLs are disabled. Browser CORS is limited to `https://match.meta-uber-engineer.dev`.

Operator-authenticated identity provisioning can happen before routing is configured; it returns only public identity and device-certificate data. Challenge, intake, event status, and activation remain closed until a configured scope and signed approval exist. The production proof activated one exact owner-approved scope and applied a synthetic Lead through Clef; no applicant or email content was used. Future integrations must use the owner's exact workspace, board, columns, fields, and signed expiry. Do not add placeholder scopes.

Cloudflare Email Routing remains unconfigured. The proposed forwarding recipient `jobs@inbox.meta-uber-engineer.dev` is not provisioned or active. No live Gmail envelope sender has been verified, so keep `emailAddress` unset until a real delivery proves the outer SMTP sender. This repository does not provision email accounts or forwarding routes.
