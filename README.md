# tincanban

A board for keeping track of work, with cards, documents, and chat. Your data lives
in your browser. You can share a board with someone else or connect your own
second device and keep working across both.

[Try tincanban](https://match.meta-uber-engineer.dev/) · [Five-minute demo](docs/demo.md) · [Architecture](docs/architecture.md)

## What you can do

- Create a blank board or a job-search pipeline; edit cards, columns, and fields.
- Attach documents, preview supported files, and download attachments.
- Render Markdown in card bodies, notes, chat, documents, and template previews.
  Task lists use `- [ ]` / `- [x]`. Editors can toggle tasks in cards, notes,
  editable documents, and template drafts; visitors and immutable chat/file
  previews remain read-only.
- Work locally, then synchronize with another online device.
- Share selected boards with an editor or a read-only visitor.
- Inspect item history and restore an earlier version without erasing history.
- Cards with saved messages show a count on their permanent chat icon. Open the
  discussion from the icon; empty cards offer it on hover/focus. Select text for a quoted
  discussion, or right-click a card/field for the app's context menu. References
  return to their source. Reply opens a thread; workspace chat shows reply counts
  and collapsed read-only previews with Open controls. Item, discussion, and chat
  windows can move and resize together.
- Export a `.tincanban` workspace bundle. Identity secrets are not included.

tincanban is an experimental application. Keep an independent backup of important
work. Browser storage is a local copy, not a hosted backup service.

## Card aging

Inactive cards gradually turn olive and then brown after 7, 14, and 30 days.
Owners can change these thresholds under **Edit board → Edit item/lead**.
Editing a card, adding a note, or moving it to another column restarts its
activity clock. Reordering within a column does not.
Archived cards and columns named Done, Complete, or Completed are excluded.
The display calculates age locally; the passage of time does not write to the
shared document.

## Try sharing a board

1. Open tincanban in two browsers or browser profiles. Give each profile a different
   display name so it is easy to tell them apart.
2. In the first browser, create a board and a card.
3. Open **Sync → Add someone**, choose the board and role, and generate a link.
4. Open that link in the second browser, request access, and approve it in the first.
5. Edit a card as an editor and watch the other browser update. Reload the second
   browser to check that its access and data persist.

**Add my device** is a separate flow: it enrolls another device as the same user.
Compare the authentication codes and approve on the existing device. Use a fresh
profile for a demo so you do not enroll someone else's browser into your identity.

The header and tab icon follow the active board's confirmed connections. Green
means a live device channel or a successful Rusty replication pass within 45
seconds. Yellow means checking, catching up, or no configured connections; red
means configured connections are unavailable or their confirmation is overdue.
The header tooltip reports devices and Rusty separately. **Sync → Rusty** shows
each server's actual state and last successful sync in this tab. Saved settings
alone never count as connected. Reduced motion disables reconnecting animation.

Standalone Rusty now uses **Sync → Rusty** and protocol 2 encrypted object
storage. Its service key signs storage receipts; it receives no readable board
invitation, content key, or Editor/Visitor application grant. Board history and
chat are encrypted by clients, which still verify authorizations before merging.
See [keeper service](../mesh-lighthouse/README.md) for setup and migration.

Readable protocol 1 services are no longer configurable in the application UI.
Existing deployments and grants require explicit migration to a fresh storage
volume. Private keys and attachment replication are not automatically transferred
to the new service.

The [demo guide](docs/demo.md) covers offline edits, attachments, and what to explain
when showing the project.

## Identity and access

- Enrolling into another identity requires explicit confirmation. The previous
  identity is backed up locally; enrollment does not merge people or their rights.
- Conflicting workspace IDs or owners stop the import without replacing the local
  board. A newer grant cannot be overwritten by an older network announcement.
- In **Sync**, an owner can select a visitor and choose **Make editor**.
- **Remove device** asks whether to apply to this board or all eligible boards,
  listing the affected boards. Editors can remove their own other devices; owners
  can remove other participants' devices only from boards they own. Removal is
  signed and survives reconnects. Reusing a removed device requires a new device
  identity; old local copies cannot be remotely erased. After opening a new member
  invitation, **Confirm reconnection** renews its device key under the same locally
  held identity root, then requests one owner approval for the new key. The owner
  rejects revoked keys before asking for approval. If the local removal record is
  missing, **Reconnect this device** opens confirmation after that rejection.
  This recovery action requires the locally held identity root. Enrolled devices
  without it require a fresh device identity issued by an authorized device.
- **Leave mesh** leaves the participant's membership on all their devices for that
  board, while preserving the identity and other boards. Owners must transfer
  ownership first. A peer must be connected to deliver the departure; the local
  copy remains read-only, and returning requires a new invitation.

Reload tincanban on both sides after this protocol update. Older clients cannot join
sessions until they support device removals and membership departures.

## Settings scopes

Deployment topology, source locations, infrastructure ownership and import-first
Hetzner/DNS configuration: [production architecture](../hetzner_playground/docs/architecture.md).

- **Identity:** display name, one profile photo across workspaces, encrypted identity recovery, device diagnostic consent.
- **Workspace:** shared document templates,
  priority rules for the named board, and collapsed advanced JSON configuration.
- **Connections:** shortcuts to the single Participants/devices, Rusty storage and
  Backups views. Ownership succession belongs to Participants; workspace import
  and export belong to Backups.

Removing a participant explicitly revokes all their devices in that workspace.
Removing a single device remains a separate action. Both disclose their scope.
**Connections → Automations** lets the owner add a supported Worker instance, pause,
resume or remove it. Desired state is shared through CRDT. Confirmed state requires
a signed Worker acknowledgement of those exact commands. Reading access applies
to the entire workspace; grants last 30 days. New UI instances support website
job intake; email routing still requires deployment configuration.

## Run locally

Requirements: Git and Node.js 22 or newer. Rust is **not** needed to run tincanban:
the pinned MetaMesh dependency contains its prebuilt browser JavaScript and WASM.
Automerge also ships its compiled WASM in its npm package.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/bobishh/tincanban.git
cd tincanban
npm ci
npm run dev
```

For an existing checkout:

```sh
git submodule sync --recursive
git submodule update --init --recursive
npm ci
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. A phone accessing a development server needs
a secure browser context for the cryptographic/browser APIs; use the HTTPS demo
for a two-device trial unless you have configured local HTTPS.

```sh
npm run build            # type-check and create dist/
npm run preview          # serve the production build locally
```

External sync diagnostics require a collector configured once per deployment.
Set the public frontend build values listed in [.env.example](.env.example): intake
URL, project, browser write key, level, sample rate and batch size. Both URL and key
are required; invalid values disable sending. Use `.env` locally or Cloudflare build
variables in production. These values become public browser assets; backend/desktop
secret write keys belong only in backend runtime secrets.

**Settings → Identity** contains only **Send diagnostics from this device** when a
collector is configured. The consent choice applies to this browser across
workspaces and survives reload. Old local collector URLs and keys are ignored;
explicit old opt-out survives. **Settings → Connections → Diagnostic delivery**
shows queued/dropped events, last confirmed send and delivery failures. The
collector must accept the [version 2 contract](openspec/changes/configurable-telemetry/design.md).
Local diagnostic snapshots remain available when external sending is disabled.
No message/card contents or raw errors are sent. IDs are complete and numeric
attributes retain their types. Chat/change events share an entity correlation
trace across devices; this does not measure precise cross-device network latency.

[MetaMesh](https://github.com/bobishh/meta-mesh) is a public repository pinned as a
Git submodule. No GitHub credentials or deploy key are required to fetch it. Its
packages are consumed from source; they are not currently published to npm.
Only contributors changing the Rust runtime need its [WASM build instructions](vendor/meta-mesh/scripts/build-wasm.sh).

## Verify changes

```sh
npm run verify:meta-mesh
npm run quality
npm test
npm run test:coverage    # unit HTML/JSON/LCOV report and regression floors
npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright test --project=core
```

The core browser suite exercises local UI and persistence. Network suites use real
Iroh connectivity and are separate so connectivity failures are visible:

```sh
npx playwright test --project=scoped-enrollment
npx playwright test --project=workspace-roles
npx playwright test --project=workspace-sync-data
npx playwright test --project=durable-mesh
```

[Coverage and typed lint](docs/testing/coverage-and-lint.md) explains report commands,
current regression floors, and existing lint debt. The [scenario audit](docs/testing/test-suite-audit.md)
records reduction candidates and the risks each surviving browser scenario must protect.
The complete [description inventory](docs/testing/test-description-inventory.tsv)
covers browser declarations, application/Worker units, meta-mesh package units,
and Rust test identifiers. Regenerate it with
`npm run --silent test:inventory > docs/testing/test-description-inventory.tsv`.
Parameterized declarations are marked; they are not expanded execution counts.

See [playwright.config.ts](playwright.config.ts) for all projects. CI runs the static
checks, unit tests, bundle budgets, dependency audit, and browser suites. Historical
measurements in [CODE_QUALITY_AUDIT.md](CODE_QUALITY_AUDIT.md) are dated snapshots,
not a substitute for the current CI result.
The verification jobs start independently: browser suites do not wait for the
unit/formal/UI jobs. The complete network project matrix remains automatic;
manual dispatch runs the same checks. Browser processes remain isolated per
network project, with three independent projects allowed concurrently. Core
shards still divide the retained UI suite; they are not a reduction in coverage.
Root Vitest runs vendored package tests once; native CI also runs Rust core rules.
Dedicated blind Rusty verification uses `playwright.rusty.config.ts` and requires
the matching binary from the sibling `mesh-lighthouse` checkout. The removed old
CI lifecycle job targeted a deleted project and a protocol-1 fixture; it cannot
verify the current blind-storage protocol. Publishing a pinned protocol-2 fixture
is still required before that dedicated check can run on GitHub.

## Recovery and verification

The [durable mesh browser suite](e2e/durable-mesh.spec.ts) exercises real Iroh
connections and browser storage, including:

- Unexpected transport-node closure: create a replacement node, reconnect, and
  synchronize edits in both directions without reloading or pairing again.
- Failed receive persistence: leave the saved document and journal unchanged,
  send no saved-state acknowledgement, then replay and acknowledge after storage
  recovers and the connection is re-established.
- Repeated disconnections with two tabs of one device: converge on edits, retain
  roles, and check that nodes, sessions, and timers do not accumulate. Each tab
  has an independent channel; opening a tab does not create another device.

An ownership handoff keeps its pending proposal separate from accepted authority.
While confirmation is pending, local document writes are blocked. Retrying uses
that same proposal; accepting the handoff stores the resulting ownership and
scope authority together.

MetaMesh also checks ownership/revocation, session generations, and batch delivery
with [executable protocol models](vendor/meta-mesh/formal/README.md). The runner
compares transitions against production Rust, explores bounded concrete states,
and requires deliberately broken implementations to fail. This is bounded
conformance testing, not a proof for every possible execution. Browser transport,
storage failures, and adapter wiring are tested separately by the scenarios above.
Recovery requires the peer, network, and storage to become available again.

Continuous workspace document synchronization runs its Rust/WASM scope state in
one dedicated browser worker. Scope effects still await storage before sending a
saved-state acknowledgement. Worker failures reject synchronization; they do not
retry the same computation on the UI thread. Admission and access checks retain
their separate workers. Transport and lightweight lifecycle bookkeeping remain
in the browser's main context.

## Discuss objects

Use **Discuss** on an item or field, or select text and choose **Discuss selection**.
Messages keep signed references to their source. Item discussions and reply views
show the same records as workspace chat; replies quote their immediate target.
Select participants through **Invite @participant** to attach stable identity
mentions. Mentions retain workspace visibility and do not create private messages.

Item, chat, and discussion windows share movement, resizing, and focus order.
Drag the title bar or resize handle; focused controls support arrow keys and
Shift for larger steps. **Next window** cycles views, including on narrow screens.
Window geometry stays local to each workspace. Native content zoom remains available.
Default illustrated avatars derive from participant identity and survive renames;
no image service or avatar upload is required.

**Copy message link** targets a committed message. Receiving devices must already
have workspace access; links do not download or join workspaces. Missing history,
unknown workspaces, loading failures, and revoked access have separate feedback.
Contextual messages require current, connected peer capability negotiation;
older peers must upgrade before rich messages can be sent. Existing plain chat
messages remain readable. The chat journal still retains at most 2,000 messages
or 4 MiB per scope.

## What to expect

- **Availability:** another device must be reachable to receive new data or fetch
  an attachment that is not stored locally. There is no permanent hosted replica.
- **Connectivity:** peers use Iroh discovery and relay infrastructure when needed;
  P2P does not mean infrastructure-free or guaranteed connectivity on every network.
- **Local startup:** Rust/WASM policy code loads before stored documents are opened.
  No network connection to another peer is needed, but local-first does not yet
  include a service worker guaranteeing a cold offline launch.
- **Permissions:** owner/editor/visitor checks run at command and replication
  boundaries as well as in the UI. Revocation reaches offline peers when they
  reconnect; it cannot erase copies they already hold.
- **Recovery:** ownership succession is a trusted-group feature, not Byzantine
  consensus. tincanban has no complete account recovery or stolen-device recovery UI.
  MetaMesh's recovery primitives alone do not supply that product flow.
- **Protocol updates:** refresh both peers when testing a new deployment.
- **Security:** signed changes and device certificates are implemented; the system
  has not received an independent security audit or Signal-equivalent guarantees.

## How it is built

Vue presents the board. Application modules coordinate commands, storage, and
collaboration. Automerge represents workspace history; IndexedDB stores local
snapshots and authorization records. MetaMesh supplies shared identity, protocol,
transport, and runtime primitives used by tincanban and Twang.

The [architecture notes](docs/architecture.md) explain these boundaries and the
remaining compromises. The [protocol and WebMCP reference](docs/protocol-and-tools.md)
contains the detailed feature and tool catalog.

### Blind Rusty storage

The standalone `../mesh-lighthouse` service now runs protocol 2 opaque storage. In **Sync → Rusty**, a board owner supplies the HTTPS origin and operator token. The browser generates the reading key locally and replicates encrypted board history, authorization proofs, and chat. Rusty receives no readable board invitation or application grant. Receivers still enforce signed causal admission. Attachments use existing device sync.

Private access files contain reading keys and storage tokens; transfer them privately to devices already authorized for the board. Settings are local to the identity on this device. Local disconnection does not revoke other storage credentials. Old plaintext Keeper volumes fail closed and require a fresh storage directory plus explicit client migration; old Keeper board grants must be revoked separately. Setup, quotas, storage-token revocation, and container configuration: [Rusty README](../mesh-lighthouse/README.md).

Cloudflare Worker + Clef ingestion uses an independent identity and an exact owner-signed Automation grant. **Settings → Connections → Automations** enrolls the Worker by owner signature and privately sends its activation packet; its workspace-wide reading scope is disclosed before approval. The real production Worker has created a synthetic Lead through live Clef and blind Rusty. Interview/Rejected transitions are verified locally; Gmail forwarding and a real received email are still pending. See [implementation evidence and rollout limits](openspec/changes/blind-keeper-and-scoped-automation/implementation.md) and the [Worker setup](workers/automation/README.md).
